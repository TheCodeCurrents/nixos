# Jflocke's NixOS Flake Configuration: Productivity & Ricing

Hey! This is my personal NixOS configuration. It's a living document and setup, tailored for my workflow, devices, and taste. While you might find inspiration or orientation here, it's not meant to be a drop-in template for othersâ€”expect quirks, experiments, and lots of ricing!

## Multi-Device & Multi-User
- Each device has its own config in `hosts/<device>/configuration.nix`.
- Users are managed via `modules/users/<username>/home.nix` using home-manager.
- Add new devices/users by creating new folders/files and referencing them in `flake.nix`.

## Productivity Stack
- **Terminal**: Fish shell with Starship prompt, custom aliases, functions, and completions for speed and ergonomics.
- **Neovim**: Fully configured with plugins for coding, writing, and ricing (themes, icons, LSP, etc.).
- **DevShells**: Use [devenv](https://devenv.sh) to create reproducible environments for Bevy, Svelte, and other stacks. Each user can have their own devshells.
- **System Tweaks**: Fast keybindings, clipboard integration, notification management, and more.

## Ricing & Aesthetics
- **DEs & WMs**: Easily switch between Gnome, Plasma 6, Hyprland, Qtile, bspwm, etc.
- **Themes**: GTK, Qt, and WM themes, custom wallpapers, icon packs, and fonts.
- **Terminal Ricing**: Beautiful prompt, color schemes, and transparency.
- **Neovim Ricing**: Custom colorschemes, statusline, icons, and UI tweaks.
- **Lockscreen, Login, and Boot**: Custom plymouth, SDDM/GDM themes.

## Dev Environments
- **devenv**: Define per-user, per-project devshells in `modules/users/<username>/devshells.nix`.
- **Supported stacks**: Bevy (Rust game engine), Svelte (JS framework), and more.
- **Automatic setup**: Enter a project folder and run `nix develop` for instant environment.

## Home Manager & Dotfiles
- **Declarative dotfiles**: Every config (fish, neovim, git, etc.) is managed via home-manager.
- **Portable**: Move your setup to any device by switching host/user configs.
